This is a new file from b1.

This line is added from b2.

Making changes on b3, and about to try to rebase this off of branch b1.

This is b1 after creating b4 from b1.

This is now on b4, after making change to b1


Gonna add two more lines to b1
so i can do another rebase on b4 and hopefully end up with these 3
lines actually in b4 after rebase


This is the dc-1 branch now, going to try this rebase stuff again.
Going to make another `dc-2` branch and checkout it off this branch.
Make some changes to the existing lines and then do a rebase:)

Going to the third line to read: "My name is Dermot" instead of:
"This line is added from b2".
